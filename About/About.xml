[h1]Description[/h1]
Generates bulk recipes for what crafts too fast.

Scans recipes on game launch and makes copies for those with a short crafting time, multiplying ingredients count, products count, and work amount.
Right click original recipe in "Add bill" list to see corresponding bulk ones.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Safe to add to saves.
To safely remove it remove bills on work tables that uses this mod's recipes first (can be done automatically by using button on mod settings page).
Should work with recipes from other mods, however it is not properly tested yet.
